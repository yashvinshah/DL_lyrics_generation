Introduction:
Music plays a significant role in human culture, serving as a powerful tool for expression, storytelling, and emotional connection. Song lyrics, in particular, form the heart of a song, conveying themes, narratives, and emotions that resonate with listeners. However, songwriting can be a challenging and time-consuming process. This project explores the potential of deep learning to assist songwriters by automatically generating lyrics.
Problem Statement:
The traditional songwriting process relies heavily on creativity and inspiration, making it difficult to consistently produce high-quality lyrics. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a deep learning model capable of generating novel and coherent song lyrics. The model will leverage two powerful algorithms, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to capture the sequential nature of language and learn the stylistic patterns present in song lyrics.
Here's a breakdown of the algorithms you'll be focusing on:
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are a type of neural network specifically designed for sequential data like text. They have an internal memory that allows them to process information from previous steps in the sequence, making them well-suited for tasks like language modelling and lyric generation.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks: LSTMs are a special type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem, a limitation faced by vanilla RNNs. LSTMs can learn long-term dependencies within sequences, making them ideal for capturing the complex relationships between words in song lyrics.
By utilizing these algorithms, the project seeks to achieve the following objectives:
•	Generate novel and grammatically correct lyrics.
•	Capture the stylistic patterns of a particular genre or artist.
•	Provide songwriters with a tool to overcome writer's block and spark new creative ideas.
